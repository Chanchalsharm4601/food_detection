## Image Classification Model
Project Overview
This project aims to classify food images using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. The project uses OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlowâ€™s GPU support (if available) to speed up the process. The model can predict the category of a food item given an input image.

## Features
Model Loading and Prediction: The project provides a notebook for loading a pre-trained model and making predictions on images.
Custom Food Image Classifier: Uses a custom Python module food_image_classifier for image processing and classification.
GPU Acceleration: TensorFlow's GPU capabilities can be leveraged to speed up training and inference.

## Installation

Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/Chanchalsharm4601/food_detection.git 
Install Required Packages: You can install all necessary Python packages using the following commands:
  # pip install tensorflow
  # pip install opencv-python
  # pip install nbimporter
  
Launch Jupyter Notebook: To open and run the Jupyter Notebook files, follow these steps:
## Open the project folder in Jupyter:
  # jupyter notebook
This command will launch the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser. Navigate to the folder where the notebooks (load_model.ipynb, etc.) are located, and open them.
